# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

For week 1's homework we were tasked to refactor existing CSS and HTML code. I have edited the HTML index file to use tags that follow proper semantic structure. I replaced several DIV tags with more descriptive header, nav, and footer tags.  I also restructured the CSS stylesheet to no longer have redundant classes. For added accessibility I have added alt tags with descriptions for all images. I have also added comments to both the HTML and CSS files. During the process of completing the homework I have been pushing my changes to Github and have used descriptive commit messages for my changes. All code has been indented and spaced out to make it more readable and clear. 

The refactored site can be found here at my 
[live github page](https://mythosmystery.github.io/homework-1/)

Here is a screenshot of the finished page as well:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

**Note**: This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
